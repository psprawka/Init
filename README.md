# Init - first steps in DevOps enviroment.

This project covers the basics of system administration on Unix. It consists of many small tasks divided into three groups:
* network
* system
* scripts

### How to test init?
Many tasks with .sh extention may be tested directly from a shell. In order to test other exercises, you will need Debian virtual machine. See [the subject](https://github.com/psprawka/Init/blob/master/init.en.pdf) to get more information about the problems to solve.
